	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It is a crucial measure for determining how efficient an algorithm is, especially when comparing multiple solutions to the same problem. For example, an algorithm with O(log n) time complexity is generally more efficient than one with O(nÂ²) when dealing with large datasets, as it requires fewer steps to reach the result. Understanding time complexity helps developers design programs that perform well even at scale.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>, on the other hand, measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input. It includes memory for variables, data structures, recursion stacks, and temporary storage. For instance, an algorithm that requires an additional array of size n has a space complexity of O(n), while one that uses only a constant amount of extra memory has a space complexity of O(1). Evaluating space complexity is important to ensure that algorithms not only run fast but also remain memory-efficient.</p>
